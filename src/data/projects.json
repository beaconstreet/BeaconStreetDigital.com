    "description": "Sh*t To Do With Kids is a project I embarked on with a friend and fellow dad. \n \n Lacking easy-to-access resources for great activities to do with our kids on the weekends, we created a hyper-local newsletter to allow parents to find at least 5 things to do in their LA neighborhood. \n\n  I tackled the design and coding of both the landing page and the email newsletter template, and the coding of the backend, utilizing Python scripts and the OpenAI API to turn the spreadsheet of events we found into both social posts to be auto-scheduled throughout the week, as well as newsletters for 5+ neighborhoods in LA via the ConvertKit API.\n \n Coding email newsletters are infamously tricky because of the different ways that email clients render HTML.  Not to mention our chosen email service, ConvertKit, has their own idiosyncrasies.  I'm proud of the result, and it's been a lot of fun to watch the newsletter grow in subscribers.",
